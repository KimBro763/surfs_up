# **Surfs Up**

## **Project Overview**

_An analysis of climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib._


The background of the Surf's Up project was to determine the viability of a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. After connecting with an investor, an analysis of weather station data was conducted to discover the best potential location for the business. Once completed, an analysis of weather patterns in June and December was performed to provide a board of investors with additional insights of the potential for year-round sustainability. 





## **Results**

* _Min and Max Temps_

    The month of June recorded higher temperatures (Min = 64F, Max = 85F) than the month of December (Min = 56F, Max = 83F). 
    
* _Mean Temps_

    The mean temperature in June (75F) was higher than the mean teamperature in December (71F). 


* _Number of Observations_

    Overall, the temperatures in June are more hospitable for surfing and ice cream than in December. However, the month of June recorded almost 200 more temperature observations than the month of December. Further research is required to understand the differences and impact of this data point.





## **Summary**  
In conclusion, June temperatures may attract more tourists, and in turn, increase sales. Even so, further analysis comparing precipitation and temperature observations across all months would provide additional benefit to this analysis. I also recommend reviewing temperature observation and precipitation data for the weather station closest to the proposed business location. The addition of these analyses could provide further insights into determining year-round sustainability.
